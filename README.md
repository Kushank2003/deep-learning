Deep Learning model to predict the different type of fashion accessories.


Context: Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a
training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is
a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends
Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST
dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image
size and structure of training and testing splits.

Details of datasets:
Each target variable for training and test example is assigned to one of the following
labels:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
